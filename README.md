An interface for modular control of realtime reactive VJ interface. Uses 2 audio files and 2 video files as input, routed through an A/V effects matrix.

Requires the yin~ external.

There are instructions in the patch.

Quickstart: press 1 to play both audio files and press toggle to play both video files.
Route buf1/2 to loud/env/yin + dacL/R. Then experiment with video mixer routing!
